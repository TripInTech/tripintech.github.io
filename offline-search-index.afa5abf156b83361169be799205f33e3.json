Our requirements were quickly converted into an action plan and then the project moved into the execution phase. Throughout the entire process, Wael asked concise questions to clarify the requirements and our engineering process. It was a pleasure to work with Wael and I will do so the next time we have a need that matches his technical background. Dan Green, Co-founder\nMotive I have had the pleasure of working with Wael at Motive for over 4 years. Wael was instrumental in architecting Motive’s mono repo and CI/CD architecture. He led a team of global engineers to build out the platform. Wael is an effective collaborator and he is a pleasure to work and solve problems with. Wael held office hours every week to help mentor and answer questions from engineers across the organization to help make the transition smooth. Chandrika Iyer, Senior Engineering Manager\nMotive It was an absolute pleasure working with Wael, and I hope to again some day. Any environment will be lucky to have his years of architectural, design, and implementation experience that spans every type of service, tech stack, and automation. A swiss army knife in an org, but with surgical solutions that achieve exactly what’s needed. Very few can achieve such breadth, while bringing detail to deliver the specifics as well. Makes for a great collaborator and executor, that’s always a treat to team up with, and that any org is better for having.
