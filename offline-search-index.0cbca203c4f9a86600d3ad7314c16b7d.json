His focus as a Lead Platform Engineer included security, infrastructure, developer productivity, and embedded systems. See some of his notable projects below.\nBuilding a High-Performance Development Ecosystem As a co-founder of Trip In Tech, my passion for optimizing developer workflows stems from my experience leading Motive’s developer productivity team. I was responsible for enhancing the development process across diverse platforms, including backend, frontend, mobile, and embedded systems.\nTo achieve this, I spearheaded two major initiatives:\nMigrating to a Go-based Microservices Architecture: Recognizing the limitations of the existing Ruby-based system, I led the transition to Go. This shift resulted in significant performance improvements, increased scalability, and enhanced maintainability of the backend services.\nCreating a Nix-Powered Mono-repository: I implemented a cutting-edge mono-repository, leveraging Nix for efficient dependency management and Bazel for streamlined build and deployment automation. This approach further boosted developer efficiency and collaboration across all platforms.\nThis combination of strategic technology choices and a focus on developer experience significantly improved productivity and paved the way for faster innovation at Motive.\nModernizing Deployments: From Legacy Systems to Kubernetes At Motive, I spearheaded the critical initiative of migrating our applications from a legacy deployment system based on redundant Git repositories and manual deployments to EC2 instances to a modern, containerized infrastructure orchestrated by Kubernetes. This transition was essential to improve scalability, reliability, and developer agility.\nThis complex project involved:\nContainerizing Applications: We packaged our applications and their dependencies into Docker containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.\nBuilding a Kubernetes Cluster: We designed and deployed a robust Kubernetes cluster on AWS, providing a scalable and self-healing platform for our containerized applications.\nAutomating Deployments: We implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, significantly reducing manual effort and increasing deployment frequency.\nThis migration to Kubernetes resulted in:\nIncreased Scalability and Reliability: Kubernetes enabled us to dynamically scale our applications based on demand and ensured high availability through self-healing capabilities.\nImproved Developer Efficiency: Automated deployments and a streamlined infrastructure allowed developers to focus on building and shipping features faster.\nReduced Operational Overhead: Kubernetes simplified infrastructure management, reducing the time and resources required for maintenance and troubleshooting.\nThis successful modernization project demonstrates my ability to lead complex infrastructure transformations, delivering significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and reliability.\nBuilding a Robust Data Pipeline with Kafka and Debezium At Motive, I recognized the need for a more efficient and scalable solution for data processing and integration between our various services. To address this, I led the adoption of Apache Kafka as our central data pipeline. This initiative involved:\nEvaluating and Selecting a Kafka Vendor: To ensure optimal performance and reliability, we conducted a thorough evaluation of different Kafka vendors, considering factors such as scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. Based on our assessment, we selected a vendor that best met our requirements.\nIntegrating Kafka with Existing Services: We seamlessly integrated the chosen Kafka service with our existing applications, enabling them to publish and consume data efficiently.\nLeveraging Kafka Connect and Debezium: To further enhance our data infrastructure, I introduced Kafka Connect and Debezium. This allowed us to capture changes from our PostgreSQL databases in real-time and replicate them to Snowflake, our data warehouse, for analytics and reporting.\nThis Kafka-based data pipeline delivered significant benefits:\nImproved Data Processing Efficiency: Kafka’s high-throughput architecture enabled us to process large volumes of data with low latency.\nEnhanced Scalability and Reliability: Leveraging a managed Kafka service provided enhanced scalability and fault tolerance, guaranteeing reliable data delivery.\nReal-time Data Integration: Debezium’s change data capture capabilities enabled real-time data replication to Snowflake, empowering data-driven decision-making.\nThis project showcases my ability to design and implement robust data pipelines, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Kafka and Debezium to improve data processing, integration, and analysis.\n","categories":["Portfolio","Full-time"],"description":"Lead Engineer -- Platform, Full-time","excerpt":"Lead Engineer -- Platform, Full-time","ref":"/portfolio/motive/","tags":["AWS","Bazel","Go","Kafka","Kubernetes","Nix","Protocol Buffers","Snowflake","Terraform","gRPC"],"title":"Motive"},{"body":" Linnaeus is an open source cybersecurity threat intelligence.\nEnhancing Infrastructure Management and Security at Linnaeus Linnaeus relied on AWS to power its infrastructure, and I was brought in to address key challenges related to infrastructure management, security, and access control.

Our requirements were quickly converted into an action plan and then the project moved into the execution phase. Throughout the entire process, Wael asked concise questions to clarify the requirements and our engineering process. It was a pleasure to work with Wael and I will do so the next time we have a need that matches his technical background. Dan Green, Co-founder\nMotive I have had the pleasure of working with Wael at Motive for over 4 years. Wael was instrumental in architecting Motive’s mono repo and CI/CD architecture. He led a team of global engineers to build out the platform. Wael is an effective collaborator and he is a pleasure to work and solve problems with. Wael held office hours every week to help mentor and answer questions from engineers across the organization to help make the transition smooth. Chandrika Iyer, Senior Engineering Manager\nMotive It was an absolute pleasure working with Wael, and I hope to again some day. Any environment will be lucky to have his years of architectural, design, and implementation experience that spans every type of service, tech stack, and automation. A swiss army knife in an org, but with surgical solutions that achieve exactly what’s needed. Very few can achieve such breadth, while bringing detail to deliver the specifics as well. Makes for a great collaborator and executor, that’s always a treat to team up with, and that any org is better for having.
